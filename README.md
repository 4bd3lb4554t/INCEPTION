# 🐳 INCEPTION - A Docker-based Web Infrastructure

Welcome to **INCEPTION** – a 42 School project that introduces you to the world of containerized services using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. The goal of this project is to set up a secure, scalable, and modular web infrastructure from scratch using multiple Docker containers.

---

## 📦 Overview

This project sets up a WordPress-based web service running on an Nginx server with a MariaDB database in a secure, containerized environment. You will also configure domain names, SSL encryption, and a persistent volume system – all orchestrated through Docker Compose.

---

## 🧱 Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the main components and how they interact:

## 🚀 Services Explained

### 🗃️ 1. MariaDB (Database)
- Acts as the **backend database** for WordPress.
- Initializes with custom credentials (defined in `.env`).
- Persists data using **named Docker volumes** to prevent data loss on container restart.

📁 Folder: `requirements/mariadb`

🔧 Includes:
- Initialization script to create a DB and user.
- Secure configuration options.

---

### 📝 2. WordPress (CMS)
- A dynamic content management system served via PHP.
- Communicates with the MariaDB database to store/retrieve content.
- Configured via CLI on first boot using a custom script.

📁 Folder: `requirements/wordpress`

⚙️ Includes:
- Automatic installation of WordPress using `wp-cli`.
- Connection to the database using environment variables.

---

### 🌐 3. Nginx (Web Server)
- Acts as a **reverse proxy** to serve WordPress over HTTPS.
- Configured to handle SSL (with self-signed certificates).
- Listens on port 443 for secure connections.

📁 Folder: `requirements/nginx`

🔒 Features:
- SSL certificate generation with OpenSSL.
- Secure redirection and static file delivery.

---

## 📁 Volumes & Persistence

All data is stored in Docker **volumes**, ensuring persistence across container restarts. For example:
- WordPress uploads
- MariaDB data

These volumes are defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## 🛠️ Makefile Commands

This repo comes with a `Makefile` to simplify managing your containers.

| Command           | Description                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `make`           | Build and start all containers    |
| `make down`      | Stop and remove containers        |
| `make fclean`    | Full cleanup (containers, volumes)|
| `make rebuild`   | Rebuild all containers from scratch|

---

## 🔐 Security

- All services run with **non-root** users.
- Passwords and secrets managed via `.env` file.
- SSL encryption enabled via self-signed certs.
- MariaDB access is restricted and protected.

---

## 🌍 Domain and Networking

- Services are hosted on a virtual machine.
- You configure a **custom domain** (e.g., `yourname.42.fr`).
- Nginx handles domain routing and HTTPS.

---

## ✅ Project Requirements (42 School)

- Use Docker containers only (no host installs).
- No `:latest` tags; pin all image versions.
- Use Docker volumes for persistence.
- Host all services on the same network.
- Services must restart automatically.
